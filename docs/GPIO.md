# What is GPIO

GPIO, or General Purpose Input and Output, is typically an electrical interface on a computer that is not dedicated to a single task. On the Agon this is exposed as a series of pins for the user to interface to. This might be for input controls, such as a joystick or buttons, motion sensors, or outputs to control your Christmas tree lights, send data to other displays, microprocessors, or even connect to the internet.

Whilst mostly the same, there are some slight variations across the range of Agon machines.

The first generation Agon Light has a double row of 32 pins, whereas the Agon Lght 2 has a double row of 36 pins. The additional pair of pins have been added for a battery power supply connection.

The Agon Console8 adds a few extra rows for additional connectivity to parts fo the ESP processor.
