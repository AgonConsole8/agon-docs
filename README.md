# Welcome to the community Agon Platform documentation

This is the community-driven documentation for the Agon Platform, covering the Agon Light, Olimex Agon Light 2, and the Agon Console8 hobbyist computers.  It is intended to be a comprehensive guide to the Agon Platform, including Agon MOS and VDP firmware, and the hardware and software that it supports.  It is intended to provide a guide to all of the features of the Agon platform with guidance on how to program for it, with information on the various features provided by different versions of the firmware.

This site is intended to supercede the original "official Quark documentation", and to provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date guide to the Agon Platform.  It is intended to be a living document, and to be updated as new features are added to the platform.

The original documentation for Quark firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/breakintoprogram/agon-docs/wiki). This community documentation was started because GitHub's wiki system does not allow easy contributions by users, and the original documentation contains some errors and omissions.  We don't use the wiki here, but just markdown files which are also automatically generated into a [website](https://agonplatform.github.io/agon-docs/).
